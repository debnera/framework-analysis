What does the Framework paper need?
- Watts per QoS metrics
--> this needs both QoS metrics and a couple of different setups to compare

Plotting QoS metrics
- Queue time histograms
- Avg queue time
- images per second
--> need to be compared against the day-night-cycle

Kafka metrics
- Sent images per second
--> where to get? some kafka topic count?
